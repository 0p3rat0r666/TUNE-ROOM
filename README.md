# TUNE-ROOM

TUNE ROOM is a local music player written in HTML and javascript

It is completely customizable as long as you know css (there might be a ui editor later but for right now its manual)

You currently have to manually add songs but there will be a CLT and maybe a screen

it is very easy to add songs you just add the image and song to the albums and song folders then edit the value and path arrays with the nessecary values!!


posting this for public use dude to everything going on with needing id to see and listen to things

i said in my inital tweet that itss for desktop only but thinking aabout it, it should work for mobile since it just goes in a local tab but i do plan to make it as an app maybe if i can figure that out
